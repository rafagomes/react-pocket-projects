# Pocket projects for React and redux studies

This is a list of pocket projects to serve as reference for studing React/Redux. This is my result of taking the incredible course ["Master React v16.6.3 and Redux with React Router, Webpack, and Create-React-App. Includes Hooks!"](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux) of Stephen Grider [@StephenGrider](https://github.com/StephenGrider).

The idea idea is to create and update all the projects with Typescript for those that wanna starting doing the course together of Typescript or for those that already have the proper knowledge. Typescript is working but needs some improvements thath I will make aftwerwards. This is a live repository.

## Tbe very basic (JS)
This is a very straight forward. Basically a first app without any commplexity, just show a page using React.

## Components (JS)
A basic project showing some components and the consume of `props`.

## Seasons (TS)
A project that shows winter or summer depending on your location.

## Pics (TS)
A grid of pics dinamically loaded by your search. A loved that app, you can put so much knowledge without complexity.

## Songs (TS)
First app using Redux, using data exchange between components, very intersting app to understand how things work at Redux world.

## Blog (TS)
A more complex app using the React-redux with multiple apis calls. Very interesting for those who wanna take a look on how to create a simple, but with some tricks behind the leaves.

## Streams (TS)
A complete app with React Router, Redux, React Thunk and many other things. This is a very good app example to be your reference in future implementations. PS: I didn't do the video part because was not relevant for the learning.

## Translate (TS)
A good example on how to use Context from React 16.
