# Pocket projects for React and redux studies

This is a list of pocket projects to serve as reference for studing React/Redux. This is my result of taking the incredible course ["Master React v16.6.3 and Redux with React Router, Webpack, and Create-React-App. Includes Hooks!"](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux) of Stephen Grider [@StephenGrider](https://github.com/StephenGrider).

The idea idea is to create and update all the projects with Typescript for those that wanna starting doing the course together of Typescript or for those that already have the proper knowledge.

## Tbe very basic (JS)
This is a very straight forward. Basically a first app without any commplexity, just show a page using React.

## Components (JS)
A basic project showing some components and the consume of `props`.

## Seasons (TS)
A project that shows winter or summer depending on your location.

## Pics (TS)
A grid of pics dinamically loaded by your search. A loved that app, you can put so much knowledge without complexity.

## Songs (TS)
First app using Redux, using data exchange between components, very intersting app to understand how things work at Redux world.
